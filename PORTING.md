# BiblioCraft 1.20.1 Port Plan

## Working Rules
- Breadth-first first, depth later.
- Always read `PORTING_MEMORY.md` before coding.
- Use `PORTING_MANIFEST.md` as the source index for old 1.12.2 locations.
- Keep this file updated whenever phase scope changes.

## Current Snapshot (2026-02-09)
- Old codebase scan completed across `old-1.12.2`.
- All primary registries mapped: blocks, items, block-items, tile entities, enchantments, entity, networking, GUI containers, sounds, recipes, and add-on modules.
- No fluid registry found in old source.
- 1.20.1 placeholder smoke-test pass added for all 37 legacy blocks:
- Blocks + block-items registered in-game via `DeferredRegister`.
- Creative tab now lists all registered smoke-test block items.
- Blockstate/model/item JSON files generated for all registered blocks.
- `./gradlew compileJava` passes with the new registry/assets.
- 1.20.1 placeholder smoke-test pass extended to all 31 legacy standalone items:
- Standalone items registered in-game via `DeferredRegister`.
- Creative tab now lists block-items and standalone items.
- Item model JSON files generated for all standalone items.
- `./gradlew processResources` passes with full smoke-test asset set.
- Visual baseline pass completed for smoke testing:
- Copied legacy textures and OBJ/MTL assets from `old-1.12.2` into current resources.
- Replaced all 37 block model JSON files with Forge OBJ loader definitions (`flip_v=true`).
- Replaced 31 standalone item model JSON files with legacy texture-backed models (no paper placeholders).
- Normalized legacy MTL references for 1.20 naming/path differences.
- `./gradlew processResources compileJava` passes with the visual baseline assets.
- Log-driven model validation baseline (without launching client in this pass):
- Existing `run/logs/latest.log` and `run/logs/debug.log` currently report `0` missing textures and `0` failed model loads.
- Initial custom-item 3D baseline restored for key legacy items:
- `atlas_book`, `compass`, `death_compass`, `maptool`, and `painting_canvas` now use Forge OBJ item models.
- Added `deathcompass.mtl` and `mtl_override` so death compass uses its own texture map.
- Early block visual-correction pass applied:
- Non-occluding placeholder block behavior enabled (removes full-cube face-culling assumptions).
- Added explicit block particle texture mapping to all 37 OBJ block model JSON files.
- Translated major negatively-authored OBJ meshes by `+1 x`/`+1 z` to reduce whole-model offset in static render path.
- Added follow-up `+1 z` translation for `sign.obj` and `label.obj` (still north-shifted after first pass).
- Added broad 1.12-informed OBJ `visibility` maps to many block models so static 1.20 baseline no longer renders all variant groups at once.
- Added iron material overrides for lamp/lantern model parity (`lamp_iron.mtl`, `lantern_iron.mtl`).
- Added pass-1 non-full block shapes in 1.20 registry:
- New `StaticShapeBlock` class with fixed `getShape`/`getCollisionShape`.
- Replaced full-cube placeholder registration for most display blocks with explicit voxel shapes derived from old 1.12 bounding boxes and current OBJ extents.
- `./gradlew compileJava` passes after shape wiring.
- `runClient` is still manual only (user-run visual checks), no automatic launch.
- Block/custom-item in-hand + inventory 3D pass:
- All 37 block item model JSONs now use direct Forge OBJ loader definitions (copied from block OBJ model config), not `parent` links to block models.
- Added explicit `display` transforms and `automatic_culling=false` to all OBJ-backed item models for more consistent first/third-person and GUI rendering.
- Converted `seatback1..seatback5` from flat generated sprites to OBJ-based item models using `seat.obj` part visibility maps.
- `./gradlew processResources compileJava` passes after item-model rewiring.
- Registry breadth expansion pass completed for major missing surfaces:
- Added placeholder `DeferredRegister` + entries for block entities, menu types, entity types, enchantments, and sound events.
- Added new placeholder runtime classes: `PlaceholderBlockEntity`, `PlaceholderMenu`, `SeatEntity`, `PlaceholderEnchantment`.
- Wired new registers into mod bootstrap (`BiblioCraft` constructor).
- `./gradlew compileJava` passes with the new registry surfaces.
- Block-to-block-entity hookup pass completed:
- Added `PlaceholderEntityBlock` (`EntityBlock` implementation) to resolve BE type by registry id at runtime.
- Switched all 37 block registrations in `ModBlocks` to BE-backed placeholders with explicit BE id mapping.
- Shared legacy mappings preserved: `bookcase` (`bookcase` + `bookcase_creative`) and `bibliolight` (all lamp/lantern variants).
- `desk`, `fancy_workbench`, and `printing_press` now stay full-voxel placeholders but are BE-backed.
- `./gradlew --no-daemon compileJava` passes after wiring.
- Horizontal-facing placement/state breadth pass completed:
- Added `HorizontalFacingEntityBlock` with `facing` blockstate, placement rotation, and per-facing rotated voxel/collision shapes.
- Updated `ModBlocks` placeholder helpers to use `HorizontalFacingEntityBlock` for all registered blocks.
- Rewrote all 37 blockstate JSON files to explicit `facing=north/east/south/west` variants with Y-rotation transforms.
- `./gradlew --no-daemon processResources compileJava` passes after state/rotation wiring.
- Block-item OBJ parity pass (item visibility groups) completed:
- Updated OBJ-backed item models that have dedicated `*_item` mesh groups to use legacy-equivalent item parts instead of block parts.
- Updated files: `models/item/case.json`, `models/item/framed_chest.json`, `models/item/painting_press.json`, `models/item/printing_press.json`.
- This aligns item render baselines with old `ModelCase`/`ModelFramedChest`/`ModelPaintingPress`/`ModelPrintingPress` default part sets.
- `./gradlew --no-daemon processResources compileJava` passes after visibility updates.
- Network + recipe skeleton breadth pass completed:
- Added `ModNetwork` (`SimpleChannel`) and placeholder registration of legacy packet surface:
- 23 serverbound packet placeholders.
- 10 clientbound packet placeholders.
- Added recipe infrastructure placeholders:
- `ModRecipes` with `DeferredRegister` for `RecipeSerializer` and `RecipeType`.
- `EnchantedAtlasRecipe` + `enchantedatlas` serializer/type registration as a placeholder for legacy atlas-enchant recipe flow.
- Registered network/recipe surfaces from mod bootstrap.
- `./gradlew --no-daemon compileJava` passes after wiring.
- Mounted-light placement/state parity pass completed:
- Added `MountedFacingEntityBlock` with `facing + face` (`floor/wall/ceiling`) placement/state logic.
- Switched `lamp_gold`, `lamp_iron`, `lantern_gold`, and `lantern_iron` registrations to mounted placeholders.
- Added mount-specific blockstate variants + model JSONs for wall/ceiling lamp and lantern geometry.
- `./gradlew --no-daemon processResources compileJava` passes after mounted-light wiring.
- Mount-state breadth expansion pass completed for additional legacy blocks:
- Added `FloorWallFacingEntityBlock` for old floor/wall placement logic (no ceiling state) and used it for `case`.
- Updated `MountedFacingEntityBlock` to rotate floor/ceiling shapes by `facing` (not only wall shapes).
- Switched `fancy_sign` to mounted wood placeholder and split model visibility by mount face:
- wall: sign/front only
- floor: sign/front + `feetBottom`
- ceiling: sign/front + `feetTop`
- Switched `map_frame` to mounted wood placeholder with floor/wall/ceiling shape parity baseline.
- Rewrote `case`, `fancy_sign`, and `map_frame` blockstate JSON files to `face + facing` variant grids.
- `./gradlew --no-daemon processResources compileJava` passes after mount-state expansion.
- Event-hook + seat behavior breadth pass completed:
- Added Forge FORGE-bus placeholder event subscribers for legacy hook surface:
- Common: death drop, item toss, spawn/join, seat right-click interaction.
- Client: GUI overlay and block highlight render hooks.
- Added minimal seat entity behavior:
- `SeatEntity` now persists target seat block position, pins itself to seat center, discards when seat block is missing, and self-cleans after passenger leaves.
- Implemented seat mounting baseline:
- Right-clicking `seat` block server-side spawns/reuses `SeatEntity` and mounts player.
- `./gradlew --no-daemon compileJava` passes after event/seat pass.
- Menu-open interaction breadth pass completed:
- `PlaceholderMenu` now uses real registered `MenuType` instead of `null`.
- Added block-id -> menu mapping in `ModMenus` for interactive legacy blocks.
- Added server-side placeholder menu open flow in `PlaceholderEntityBlock#use` via `NetworkHooks.openScreen`.
- This establishes compile-safe/open-safe interaction paths for placeholder menus while deeper container logic remains TODO.
- `./gradlew --no-daemon compileJava` passes after menu-open wiring.
- Item-held menu interaction breadth pass completed:
- Added `MenuOpeningItem` placeholder class for right-click item menu opens.
- Wired `atlas_book`, `slotted_book`, and `tester_item` to open their placeholder menus (`atlas`, `slotted_book`, `tester`) on main-hand use.
- Preserved stack-size parity baseline for menu-heavy books (`atlas_book`, `slotted_book` are single-stack).
- `./gradlew --no-daemon compileJava` passes after item-menu wiring.
- Sound asset migration breadth pass completed:
- Copied legacy `sounds.json` and 39 `.ogg` files into active resources under `assets/bibliocraft/`.
- Verified all 17 `ModSounds` `SoundEvent` ids match `sounds.json` keys one-to-one.
- `./gradlew --no-daemon processResources compileJava` passes after sound asset import.
- Config migration scaffold breadth pass completed:
- Added `BiblioConfig` (`ForgeConfigSpec`) with legacy-parity toggle surface (block/item enable flags, recipe toggles, render toggles, and gameplay keyword settings).
- Registered common config in mod bootstrap (`ModLoadingContext.registerConfig`).
- This is a breadth scaffold only; feature-level registry gating/behavior checks are still pending.
- `./gradlew --no-daemon compileJava` passes after config wiring.
- Config toggle runtime-consumption pass completed:
- Added `BiblioFeatureToggles` as the legacy gate mapping layer (`ResourceLocation` -> config boolean supplier).
- Applied block/item gate checks to runtime placeholder behavior:
- Creative tab output now filters block-items and standalone items by legacy toggle parity.
- Block interaction menu opens (`PlaceholderEntityBlock#use`) now respect block feature toggles.
- Item-held menu opens (`MenuOpeningItem#use`) now respect item feature toggles.
- Seat interaction hook (`CommonGameplayEvents#onSeatInteract`) now respects seat toggle parity.
- `./gradlew --no-daemon compileJava` passes after config-consumption wiring.
- Recipe data migration + runtime-gating pass completed:
- Added first representative migrated 1.20 datapack recipe family under `data/bibliocraft/recipes`:
- `maptool`, `compass`, `slotted_book`, `atlas_book`, and `enchantedatlas`.
- Upgraded `EnchantedAtlasRecipe` from no-op placeholder to a real 3x3 matcher/assembler:
- Requires atlas + 4 ender pearls + 2 waypoint compasses + 2 enchanted books.
- Adds placeholder marker NBT (`bibliocraft:death_compass_enabled=true`) to crafted atlas output.
- Gated `EnchantedAtlasRecipe.matches(...)` behind legacy parity config (`enableAtlas && enableDeathCompass && enableWaypointCompass`).
- Extended toggle checks to remaining placeholder runtime surfaces:
- `ModMenus.getMenuForBlock(...)` now returns `null` for disabled blocks.
- `CommonGameplayEvents.onItemToss(...)` now ignores disabled-item surfaces.
- `./gradlew --no-daemon processResources compileJava` passes after recipe/data/gating pass.
- Utility-item recipe migration breadth pass completed:
- Added second migrated 1.20 datapack recipe batch under `data/bibliocraft/recipes`:
- `hand_drill`, `tape`, `tape_measure`, `framing_saw`, `framing_sheet`, `framing_board`, `plumb_line`, `biblio_clipboard`, `big_book`, `biblio_red_book`, `stockroom_catalog`, `biblio_glasses`.
- Recipe conversions normalized old 1.12 ids and metadata to 1.20 naming/tag semantics:
- old `minecraft:dye` metadata replaced by `forge:dyes/*` tags where needed.
- old `minecraft:planks` metadata lists replaced by `minecraft:planks` tag ingredients.
- old legacy item ids (`handdrill`, `tapemeasure`, `framingsaw`, etc.) mapped to current 1.20 ids (`hand_drill`, `tape_measure`, `framing_saw`, etc.).
- `./gradlew --no-daemon processResources compileJava` passes after utility recipe batch.
- Core furniture block recipe migration breadth pass completed:
- Added consolidated 1.20 datapack recipes for wood/framed furniture surfaces:
- `bookcase`, `shelf`, `table`, `seat`, `seatback1`, `seatback2`, `seatback3`, `seatback4`, `seatback5`.
- Conversion strategy for missing metadata variants in current placeholder runtime:
- merged old per-wood + framed recipe families into single recipes using ingredient alternatives (`minecraft:planks`/`minecraft:wooden_slabs` and `framing_sheet`/`framing_board`).
- normalized old `wooden_pressure_plate` to `minecraft:wooden_pressure_plates` tag and old wool metadata to `minecraft:white_wool`.
- `./gradlew --no-daemon processResources compileJava` passes after furniture recipe batch.
- Supporting block recipe migration breadth pass completed:
- Added consolidated 1.20 datapack recipes for additional block families:
- `case`, `map_frame`, `fancy_sign`, `fancy_workbench`, `potion_shelf`, `tool_rack`, `armor_stand`, `framed_chest`.
- Conversion strategy reused consolidated wood/framed alternatives for current placeholder runtime:
- `minecraft:wooden_slabs` + `framing_board`, `minecraft:planks` + `framing_sheet`, plus normalized tag usage (`minecraft:signs`, `forge:dyes/black`).
- `./gradlew --no-daemon processResources compileJava` passes after supporting block recipe batch.
- Extended block + color-surface recipe migration breadth pass completed:
- Added additional consolidated 1.20 datapack recipes for remaining broad block/dependency surfaces:

- Added temporary placeholder recolor datapack flows for collapsed color-variant runtime ids:
- `lamp_gold_recolor`, `lamp_iron_recolor`, `lantern_gold_recolor`, `lantern_iron_recolor`, `sword_pedestal_recolor`, `typewriter_recolor`.
- `./gradlew --no-daemon processResources compileJava` passes after extended recipe batch.
- Legacy JSON-output recipe coverage pass completed:
- Added `painting_canvas` datapack recipe (`painting_canvas.json`) from legacy recipe set.
- Current mapped old JSON output coverage is now `58 / 58` outputs (with consolidated variant strategy still applied).
- Block loot-table breadth pass completed:
- Added first-pass block loot tables for all 37 registered blocks under `data/bibliocraft/loot_tables/blocks`.
- Current loot-table strategy is self-drop + `minecraft:survives_explosion` placeholders for survival smoke tests.
- `./gradlew --no-daemon processResources compileJava` passes after recipe + loot-table pass.
- Procedural/variant-recipe obtainability breadth pass completed:
- Added placeholder obtainability datapack recipes for non-creative, non-debug registered IDs that were still without outputs:
- `atlas_plate`, `clipboard` (from `biblio_clipboard`), `death_compass`, `print_plate`, `enchanted_plate`, `recipe_book`, `marker_pole`.
- Added deferred glasses variant recipe files from legacy set as placeholder no-op variant flows:
- `monocle` and `tinted_glasses` now map to `biblio_glasses` output in current collapsed-variant runtime.
- Current registry-ID recipe output coverage is now `65 / 68` IDs (remaining intentionally non-craftable: `bookcase_creative`, `biblio_creative_lock`, `tester_item`).
- `./gradlew --no-daemon processResources compileJava` passes after procedural/variant recipe pass.
- Typewriter/Sword pedestal color-state parity pass completed:
- Added `ColorFacingEntityBlock` (`facing + color`) and switched `typewriter` + `sword_pedestal` registrations to this block class.
- Added in-world dye application in `PlaceholderEntityBlock#use` for color-capable placeholders.
- Added 16-color OBJ material/model variants for both blocks plus `facing + color` blockstate variant maps.
- `./gradlew --no-daemon processResources compileJava` passes after color-state/model pass.
- Lamp/Lantern color-state + drop-persistence parity pass completed:
- Added `ColorMountedFacingEntityBlock` (`face + facing + color`) and switched `lamp_*` + `lantern_*` registrations to this block class.
- Expanded model/state coverage for mounted lights to 16 colors (gold/iron floor/wall/ceiling variants with color-specific MTL overrides).
- Rewrote `lamp_gold`, `lamp_iron`, `lantern_gold`, and `lantern_iron` blockstate files to `face + facing + color` variant grids.
- Added loot-table `minecraft:copy_state` for colorized blocks (`lamp_*`, `lantern_*`, `typewriter`, `sword_pedestal`) so break/re-place preserves color via `BlockStateTag`.
- `./gradlew --no-daemon processResources compileJava` passes after light color-state + persistence pass.

## Phase 7 - Add-on and Compatibility Modules
- [ ] Decide scope for BiblioWoods add-ons in 1.20.1.
- [ ] Re-implement framed texture variant support or replace with modern data-driven alternative.
- [ ] Add integration tests for optional-mod behavior.

## Near-Term Lookahead
- Convert placeholder recolor datapack recipes (`*_recolor`) into true state-aware recolor flows for `lamp_*`, `lantern_*`, `typewriter`, and `sword_pedestal`.
- Add explicit pick-block color carry (creative clone path) for colorized placeholders so middle-click preserves non-white state.
- Start wood/framed variant-state scaffolding (next open variant-strategy milestone after color-state expansion).

## Definition of Done (Port Breadth Milestone)
- [ ] Every legacy registry ID has a 1.20.1 registered counterpart.
- [ ] Game loads with all content IDs present and obtainable.
- [ ] No missing registry/object crash from legacy feature surface.
- [ ] All major systems have at least stub behavior with clear TODO anchors for depth passes.
